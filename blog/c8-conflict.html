      <p>Conflict is part of life. Here is a conflict I experienced:</p>
      <p>Once when I was playing basketball at the park, I was walking out of the park with someone else's basketball, but didn't realize I was carrying it. As I was walking out, the guy who owned the ball shoved me from behind, I think he knocked me down. I apologized to him and he took his ball. He yelled at me also. My friends thought we should retaliate but I said not to.</p>
      <p>This happened probably over 10 years ago. I felt unable to physically defend myself because the other guy was a lot bigger than me. That made me feel like I could not really do anything. Ultimately when I think about it now, I was in the wrong because I was walking out of the park with the guy's basketball. But the other guy was also wrong because he did not have to push me, he could of just asked me for the ball. Now that I think about it, the guy probably pushed me because he knew I could not really retaliate.</p>
      <p>What did I learn from this? Not much. What would I do differently? Not walk out of the park with someone else's basketball. But then, I did not even realize I had it. He thought I was intentionally stealing his basketball. But he did not have to push me to get the ball back. Not quite sure how this could have been avoided, or what I could have done differently in response.  Ultimately my response avoided any escalation of the matter.</p>
      <p>Sometimes there is no way to avoid conflict, but escalating conflict we can avoid.</p>
      <p>Maybe I should have decked the guy. But that would not have ended well.</p>
