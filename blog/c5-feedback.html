    Pairing:

What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?
Was something particularly fun or rewarding?
Was something frustrating and difficult for you?
Feedback

How did you feel when you read your feedback?
Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?
Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?
How was it to write feedback?
What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?
Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning? -->
      <p>Currently I am student at Dev Bootcamp, in the Phase 0 remote learning part of the program. Each week I am required to pair program with other students on at least two challenges. There are pros and cons to this process. Ultimately I think it has a net benefit to the learning process.</p>
      <p>Most of my pairing sessions have gone well. I have learned something from my pairing partner during each session; every time I have learned from my partner and they have learned from me. That's a good thing!</p>
      <p>Only one of my pairing sessions had any negative issues (when one of my partners rejected an idea I had, even though the idea eventually worked well). That was quite frustrating, as I gave up on my idea during the pairing session, then worked on it alone afterward and got it to work.</p>
      <p>We also must write feedback for each of our pairing partners. This has proven challenging sometimes because I cannot think of any "actionable" ways my partner can improve on how they do things.  But feedback that has no criticism is basically useless! The feedback is anonymous, which is vital to giving and receiving honest feedback. And all the feedback needs to be reviewed by other students to confirm it is kind, otherwise it never gets to the person being critiqued.  That is very wise move, because unkind feedback could do significant damage to someone.</p>
      <p>Based on some of my feedback I am going to keep pushing ahead and offer my ideas honestly, and be sure I am driving and navigating equal amounts of time.</p>
      <p>Overall the Dev Bootcamp learning experience has been unique so far. (The first nine weeks are done completely online!) Yet we are all connected and learning and growing together. By the time we get to the in-person classes we will already know each other somewhat and will be on the same page technically, or hopefully close to it.</p>
