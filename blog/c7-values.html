  <h2 class="post_title">Affirmation: Combating Stereotype Threat</h2>

      <p>This is an exercise in affirmation. Let's see where it goes.</p>
      <p>I really value mentoring other people.  This is something I have been doing for a while, and have had the opportunity to expand upon in my current profession.</p>
      <p>Why do I enjoy mentoring? I guess it makes me feel like I am doing something that actually matters. Also there is something about being able to give advice to someone that validates me as a person. If I know what I know, and have experienced what I have experienced, but do not share that with anyone, what good is it?</p>
      <p>The last time someone asked me for advice, it was actually a married couple who are about to have a child. They wanted advice on coming to an agreement on how to order their priorities over the next several months. One spouse wants to do one thing, the other spouse wants to do something else. This is something I have experienced personally, and thus was able to guide this couple, without giving them an "answer", since they have to come up with an agreement that works best for them.</p>
      <p>When I think about this interaction, it connects with some values I hold strongly: close relationships, meaningful work, wisdom, commitment, growth. Hey, maybe this is why I like doing this!</p>
      <p>Ok the affirmation exercise is done. How do I feel? Pretty good! This type of exercise would definitely help if I experience stereotype threat. We all live by the words that have been spoken to us and by us.  When our minds start to turn inward against themselves (whether because of what someone else said to us, or what we are saying to ourselves), we need to be able to pull ourselves out of that abyss.  Positive words are the only way to do this. We need words of encouragement to balance our negative thinking.</p>
      <p>The real question is, why do we tend toward negative thinking at all? Are we tearing other people down to make ourselves feel better? Are we tearing ourselves down to protect ourselves from something we fear even more? If we can control our words, both spoken and our internal monologues, we can control any part of our lives. But can anyone do that 100%?</p>
