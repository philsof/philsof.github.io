      <p>When I started looking into the IT field seriously, from the start I encountered article after article about the need to diversify America's IT sector. A few questions came up: Why hasn't this diversification happened already? What are the benefits of diversification? What are the unintended negative consequences, if any?</p>
      <p>The first question is easy to answer. Think about it like this: how many kids in in the inner city play basketball? How many play hockey?  Many more play basketball.  Why? Because it is super easy to come into contact with basketball. There are parks all over the place with rims to shoot on; all you need to play is a basketball, there is no need for any other equipment. But hockey is totally different. You need a lot of equipment. And you need a rink with boards and large goals. I live in Brooklyn. There are dozens of basketball courts, but only two roller hockey rinks that I am aware of. Thus, people are much more familiar with basketball than hockey, and much more likely to have played basketball but not hockey.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccabagley/2014/05/15/how-do-we-increase-diversity-in-the-tech-industry/">The same thing is happening in the tech field.</a> The average person does not come into contact with coders, or the work of coding. While everyone comes into contact with the product of coders, very few people actually see how that is done. And it takes a lot of understanding to set up a computer with a development environment. (Not to mention, you basically need a Mac, which is quite expensive.) These are all obstacles that keep people from becoming more familiar with coding and what coders do. And what you don't know you don't understand.</p>
      <p>But this is not just about altruism. There are financial benefits to diversifying the tech sector.</a> Diverse companies make more money, and last longer. Period.  Makes sense, since the more diverse a team's experience has been, the more understanding they should have about the needs and desires of consumers. Studies show that <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3029444/the-ugly-truth-about-silicon-valleys-diversity-problem">"Companies that don't embrace diversity of race and gender, on the other hand, run the risk of becoming insular and stultified."</a> That's big.</p>
      <p>There is a lot being done to increase diversity in the tech scene. Coding schools are intentionally diversifying their student bodies. Some schools are only training women and minorities. Huge promotional campaigns have been implemented, aiming to <a href="http://go.flatironschool.com/kode-with-karlie-winners">bring coding to young girls</a>.</p>
      <p>To me, this is the only way to diversity the tech scene; the tech door needs to be intentionally opened wider toward women and minorities who have mostly been on the outside looking in. And it is a win-win: tech companies actually benefit from having more diverse employees. That should make this a no-brainer.</p>
