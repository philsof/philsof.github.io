  <h2 class="post_title">Stereotype Threat</h2>

      <p>There is <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html">a lot of information out there</a> about  a phenomenon known as stereotype threat. I became aware of this phenomenon during the last few days. My first impressions are: my personal observations line up with the data, but I am not sure if I have ever experienced this myself. I may have though: As a native New Yorker, I have a heavy New York accent. Now that I think about it, people outside of New York generally do not seem to respond to me in the same way as those in New York, almost like I am stereotyped by them as foolish. Has this impacted my performance? I don't think so, but maybe it has.</p>
      <p>But I see this phenomenon at work frequently in communities that I live near and work in. There is clearly a different expectation regarding education for the various ethnic and racial groups in my area. I have heard stories from classrooms of certain kids being labeled "white" in a negative way by other  students, simply because the kid in question could read well or spell well. It seems like some view doing well in school as a white thing, and actually diss their friends who do well in school, like they shouldn't be doing well in school. </p>
      <p>Also, I have heard stories of some families having a sort of ceiling placed on education by fathers. It seems like some fathers get angry if their children go past their education level, like doing that is wrong. If dad got a high school diploma and no more, then none of his children should even think about going to college. Doing so would be a slap in dad's face.</p>
      <p>Obviously when large parts of people groups view education as a negative thing, nothing good can come from that. I am thankful that the home I grew up in valued education, with no restrictions or unspoken limits placed upon me. This type of stereotyping needs to be intentionally pushed against. I am a big proponent of mentoring youth to change their mindsets, which is key to overcoming this specific phenomenon.</p>
