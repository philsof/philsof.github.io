      <p>Good question. Of course, this question is being asked in the context of app/software/web development. So far, I've picked up the following keys to a good question:</p>
      <p><strong>Give all the info needed to answer the question.</strong> This seems to be a big one in the development world. But this goes for all types of questions. I try to anticipate being on the other end of the question, asking myself "What would I need to know to answer this question?" Sometimes, a lot. Here is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32173454/html-bootstrap-3-not-adding-active-class-to-ul-li" target="_blank">a question on Stack Overflow</a> in which the questioner includes a whole bunch of information from the start. (Note also that no one had to ask this person for more info to answer the question.)</p>
      <p><strong>Give all the ways you already tried to answer the question.</strong> This helps others know what you already did, thus avoiding the "Did you try this yet?" "Yes, I tried that already, it doesn't work" exchange, which is a waste of everyone's time. If you already tried a few ways to solve the issue, let everyone else know so they don't waste time trying the same thing. Also, this helps others learn your train of thought on how to solve this question, and the avenues you already tried, giving others the opportunity to try something completely different (since you already tried the most obvious ways to solve the issue). The above linked Stack Overflow questioner also does this.</p>
      <p><strong>State the question using correct names for each part of the question.</strong> This can require a lot of thinking and perhaps research. Often we may not be aware of the correct name for something, especially in development, since there are so many pieces to the puzzle. Also our questions can get quite dense, again because there are so many pieces. But the work put into wording the question with correct names will pay off with answers that actually answer your issue.</p>
      <p><strong>State the ultimate goal in your question.</strong> Sometimes we box ourselves in by assuming there is only one way to get where we want to go, so we ask questions to get that one way, instead of asking how to get to the ultimate goal. When we do this, we are handcuffing everyone else from thinking through various ways to the ultimate goal, since we only asked about how we could attain to a specific way toward that ultimate goal. Many questioners never indicate what they are ultimately after, and are only focused on a specific way to get there.</p>
      <p>Hopefully this helps us ask better questions!</p>
