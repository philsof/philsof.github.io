  <h1>Dev Bootcamp Week 1: So Far So Good</h1>

      So as of today I have been in Dev Bootcamp for five days, and am almost done with week 1 of Phase 0. Woo hoo! How is it so far? Thrilling and lonely and exciting and frustrating and repetitive and joyful. I actually feel like something is being released from inside of me that I have probably been pushing down for quite a long time, a sort of validating of what I like to do.

      I knew this coming in, and have previous experience with guided remote learning, but it still hit me: This is not going to be handed to me, I have to reach out and grab it.  All of the answers are not given; that's what Google is for! And there is no one to sit down with face-to-face and talk to, not for another nine weeks. That is cool with me, but also a reminder: <em>I</em> have to do this.

      Grit is an important part of life. It is clear the DBC experience aims to produce grit, almost like a dare: DBC is daring me to push through, to learn how to push and keep pushing. So far it is working. Definitely not a consumer culture, thank God. I won't learn anything if it is handed to me.

      Admission: It is a new thing for me to engage the social networking scene. But I do agree it is vital to do so.  I have avoided Twitter and rarely look at Facebook. That has changed today! And it needed to. DBC is pushing me into the social networking scene, almost like I am finally fully entering into world of the internet via the Twitterverse. I have avoided it to keep from wasting time but also to avoid potential criticism from others. There is a fear factor involved: what will people think of what I post? DBC is pushing me to find out, that is for sure.

      After this past week my expectations for Phase 0 are more grounded: it is going to be hard work, grinding, pushing through, time management, time boxing, time, time time, work, work, work. Doing things I want to do and things I don't want to do. But my mind is opening and I am getting it. At least so far.

      So far so good!
