  <h2 class="post_title">Let's Learn about #map in Ruby!</h2>
  <h3 class="post_subtitle">Or, my attempt to explain #map to myself</h3>
  <div class="post_date">August 1, 2015 (goodbye July!)</div>

  <div class="post_body">
    
      <p>Today's topic is a simple and powerful method in the Enumerable class in Ruby, called #map. Here is <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Enumerable.html#method-i-map">the Ruby documentation for #map</a>, which may or may not make any sense to you. (It may or may not make any sense to me!) Don't worry, hopefully I can explain it to you.</p>
      <p>Basically, #map takes an existing collection of objects and returns a new collection of objects that is generated by doing the exact same thing to each object in the original collection. That sounds complicated. But it's not. Take a look at this code, in which #map is used to add 2 to every integer in the original array:</p>
      <img src="map_1.png" alt="Some code">
      <p>In this method named "add_two", the #map method is used add 2 to each number in the original array, and return the result as a new array. So [1,2,3,4,5] is the input, then #map adds 2 to each number, then #map returns a new array of [3,4,5,6,7]. Pretty simple, right?</p>
      <p>The power comes from the flexibility of #map. Specifically, we can put whatever code we want into the codeblock (which in the above example is in line 2, the "number + 2" part). That word "number" is the variable name I decided to use in this example, and it refers to each item in the original array. The code means: add 2 to every object in the original array. I could have used any name in place of "number". In this example I use "x":</p>
      <img src="map_2.png" alt="More code">
      <p>Did you catch that? I changed "number" to "x" and it still works exactly the same, because "x" (and in the previous example, "number") represents each item in the original array.</p>
      <p>We can put methods in the #map code block. Check this out. In this one, we are going to take an array of words, and for each word #map is going to return the number of letters in each word:</p>
      <img src="map_3.png" alt="Even more code">
      <p>So "cow" has 3 letters, "moo" has 3 letters, "horse" has 5 letters, etc. Notice that the #length method is used within the #map codeblock (#length returns the number of characters in a string of characters). As you can see, we could keep nesting methods in the codeblock and come up with some pretty complicated stuff.</p>
      <p>Hopefully this makes sense! If it doesn't, don't blame me, I am new at this. Blame Johnny Ruby for writing his docs in such a way that we need another Rosetta Stone to read them. (That's right, Johnny Ruby invented Ruby. Don't look it up; just trust me. He's a real guy, like John Harvard. But he likes to be called Johnny.)</p>
