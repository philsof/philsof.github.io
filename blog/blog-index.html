  This week at DBC we started learning JavaScript. I made a game with JS that was actually fun to make. But in the process it became clear that JavaScript and Ruby are very different. In this post I want to go into some of those differences, and how JS helped me to better understand Ruby.

   Currently I am student at Dev Bootcamp, in the Phase 0 remote learning part of the program. Each week I am required to pair program with other students on at least two challenges. There are pros and cons to this process. Ultimately I think it has a net benefit to the learning process.

    This week we are delving into classes in Ruby. What are classes? Let's define them by what they do: classes create objects and assign them tailor-made methods. What does that mean? Let me try to explain with a real-world example: a commercial airline flight.

  <div class="post_body">
    When I started looking into the IT field seriously, from the start I encountered article after article about the need to diversify America's IT sector. A few questions came up: Why hasn't this diversification happened already? What are the benefits of diversification? What are the unintended negative consequences, if any? Here are some of my thoughts on the matter.

    Today's topic is a simple and powerful method in the Enumerable class in Ruby, called #map. Here is <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Enumerable.html#method-i-map">the Ruby documentation for #map</a>, which may or may not make any sense to you. (It may or may not make any sense to me!) Don't worry, hopefully I can explain it to you.

    Ok the subtitle is a joke, I just wanted to get your attention.<br><br>
    Time to reflect on Dev Bootcamp so far. Well, it's week 3, and I feel like I am getting it. "It" being the stuff I am supposed to be learning. Part of this may be my "abstract random" thinking style, which is freakin awesome. I am so glad to be an AR. I feel it gives me an advantage on adapting, and not knowing answers and being ok with searching for answers.

  <div class="post_body">
    
      So this week we covered arrays and hashes. You may be saying, what the ? Well, let me fill you in: arrays and hashes are Ruby objects that hold collections. You may still be saying, what the ? Well let me fill you in some more: computers use collections to keep track of things. What kind of things? Everything. Take a look at some baseball stats to see what I mean...

  <div class="post_body">
    
      So as of today I have been in Dev Bootcamp for five days, and am almost done with week 1 of Phase 0. Woo hoo! How is it so far? Thrilling and lonely and exciting and frustrating and repetitive and joyful. I actually feel like something is being released from inside of me that I have probably been pushing down for quite a long time, a sort of validating of what I like to do.<br><br>
      I knew this coming in, and have previous experience with guided remote learning, but it still hit me: This is not going to be handed to me, I have to reach out and grab it. All of the answers are not given; that's what Google is for! And there is no one to sit down with face-to-face and talk to, not for another nine weeks. That is cool with me, but also a reminder: I have to do this. It sounds like, as time goes on and I get to know my cohort, this will become we have to do this.

      So this is my first week of Phase 0 in Dev Bootcamp. That means I am in my home, on my newly purchased four-year old refurbished Macbook Pro (thank you macofalltrades.com!) which sailed smoothly through the dev environment installation process, thank God. We had to learn git and GitHub pretty quickly. (They are not the same!) I get it, I think. Here is my attempt to explain it to myself, so that I really get it, and hopefully you do too.
