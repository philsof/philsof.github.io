  <h2 class="post_title">Recursion!</h2>
  <h3 class="post_subtitle">Or, recursion! recursion!</h3>

  <div class="post_body">
    
      <p>Ok the subtitle of this post is a bad joke. I apologize. Especially if you do not know what recursion is. Or perhaps I should apologize especially if you do know what recursion is!</p>
      <p>So, what is recursion? In computer science, basically, it's when a function can call itself. Here is an example of recursion:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
      def foo(x)
        x = x + 1
        foo(x)
      end

      foo(2) #this is an infinite loop
      </pre> 
      <p>Above is a function named "foo" that takes one integer argument "x". It adds 1 to x, then calls foo on x. This will continue forever, since foo will add 1 to x, then call itself, then add 1 to x again, then call itself again, forever. This is recursion. But it's also an infinite loop. If you try to run this, you will get an error "stack level too deep". So let's change it a bit:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
      def foo(x)
        x = x + 1
        return x if x == 1000
        foo(x)
      end

      foo(2) #this will return 1000
      foo(1001) #this is an infinite loop
      </pre>
      <p>We added a line to this code, a conditional statement, "return x if x == 1000". When the condition is met, the recursion will cease.  foo(2) will result in 1000 (foo will keep calling itself until x equals 1000, when the conditional statement is met), but foo(1001) will result in an infinite loop, since the condition will never be met (if x starts at 1001, and foo adds 1 to x, then x will never equal 1000, and the recursion will go on forever. Error!) .</p>
      <p>Ok so let's see the power of recursion in action. Here is a way to compute the factorial of a number using recursion:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
      def factorial(x)
        if x == 0
          return 1
        else
          x * factorial(x-1)
        end
      end
 
      p factorial(4) #this will return 24  
      </pre>
      <p>Take a look at the above code. First it evaluates if x equals 0. If it does, it returns 1 (which is the factorial of 0 by definition). But if x does not equal 1, then we get to the recursion: this function takes x and multiplies it by factorial(x-1). So this is what is happening:</p>
      <p>4 * factorial(3 * (factorial(2 * (factorial(1 * factorial(0))))))</p>
      <p>which is:</p>
      <p>4 * (3 * (2 * (1 * (1))))</p>
      <p>Notice the recursion stops when we get to factorial(0), which will return 1 (instead of calling factorial again). That's why the recursion doesn't continue forever.</p>
      <p>I hope this makes sense!</p>
