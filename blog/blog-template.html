  <h2 class="post_title">Ask the Ruby Novice: Arrays vs. Hashes</h2>
  <h3 class="post_subtitle">Or, what I learned in week 3 at Dev Bootcamp</h3>
  <div class="post_date">July 26, 2015</div>

  <div class="post_body">
    
      So this week we covered arrays and hashes. You may be saying, what the ? Well, let me fill you in: arrays and hashes are Ruby objects that hold collections. You may still be saying, what the ? Well let me fill you in some more: computers use collections to keep track of things. What kind of things? Everything. Take a look at some baseball stats to see what I mean...

      Ok so I just finished week 2 of Dev Bootcamp's Phase 0. Woo hoo! This week was HTML and CSS. The CSS "Box Model" concept was covered. This is my attempt to make sense of it.

  <h2 class="post_title">Dev Bootcamp: Let's Do This</h2>
  <!-- <h3 class="post_subtitle">Subtitle</h3> -->
  <div class="post_date">July 10, 2015</div>

  <div class="post_body">
    
      So as of today I have been in Dev Bootcamp for five days, and am almost done with week 1 of Phase 0. Woo hoo! How is it so far? Thrilling and lonely and exciting and frustrating and repetitive and joyful. I actually feel like something is being released from inside of me that I have probably been pushing down for quite a long time, a sort of validating of what I like to do.<br><br>
      I knew this coming in, and have previous experience with guided remote learning, but it still hit me: This is not going to be handed to me, I have to reach out and grab it. All of the answers are not given; that's what Google is for! And there is no one to sit down with face-to-face and talk to, not for another nine weeks. That is cool with me, but also a reminder: I have to do this. It sounds like, as time goes on and I get to know my cohort, this will become we have to do this.

      So this is my first week of Phase 0 in Dev Bootcamp. That means I am in my home, on my newly purchased four-year old refurbished Macbook Pro (thank you macofalltrades.com!) which sailed smoothly through the dev environment installation process, thank God. We had to learn git and GitHub pretty quickly. (They are not the same!) I get it, I think. Here is my attempt to explain it to myself, so that I really get it, and hopefully you do too.
