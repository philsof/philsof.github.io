      <p>Ok the subtitle is a joke, I just wanted to get your attention.</p>
      <p>Time to reflect on Dev Bootcamp so far. Well, it's week 3, and I feel like I am getting it. "It" being the stuff I am supposed to be learning. Part of this may be my "abstract random" thinking style, which is freakin awesome. I am so glad to be an AR. I feel it gives me an advantage on adapting, and not knowing answers and being ok with searching for answers.</p>
      <p>Downside to being an AR: here is the list from <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">the master</a>:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Having to explain or justify feelings</li>
        <li>Competition</li>
        <li>Working with dictatorial/authoritarian personalities</li>
        <li>Working in a restrictive environment</li>
        <li>Working with people who don't seem friendly</li>
        <li>Concentrating on one thing at a time</li>
        <li>Giving exact details</li>
        <li>Accepting even positive criticism</li>
      </ol><br><br>
      Wow that is a lot! The biggest ones for me are #1, 3, 5. So I will need to make sure I assert myself in a healthy way in group situations, and also stay on task instead of getting caught on a research rabbit trail. And I also need to avoid control freaks (or assert myself when with them).
      </p>
      <p>The big thing, I think, is working from a growth mindset perspective.  A fixed mindset is death to learning. In the coding world it is impossible to know everything or keep up with the lateste innovations; the profession requires being open to learning and open to the reality that I do not know everything. It is comforting to know that I am not expected to know everything. But I am expected to learn fast and be able to find what I need to learn.  Those expectations fit me nicely, thank God.</p>
      <p>So far, no meltdowns. Let's see what week 4 brings.</p>
