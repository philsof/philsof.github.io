  <div class="center_tight">
    <p>Great question! I'm currently a student at Dev Bootcamp in NYC. In a few months I will be looking for an IT job as a coder. Will you hire me? </p>
    <p>Here is some background on me: I was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY. And I am still in Brooklyn! Why? Because Brooklyn is the best place in the world. Come on now, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Brooklyn_Bridge_Postdlf.jpg" target="_blank">look at this bridge</a>!  And yes, I have a Brooklyn accent. <a href="http://media.npr.org/assets/img/2015/02/02/ny-accent_2100_wide-364f7ed71c3a29812a44f32f4e6f3cd6ba583ca4-s800-c85.jpg" target="_blank">This woman would love me</a>.</p>
    <p>My education background is quite odd: a Bachelor's in Theatre and Religious Studies, and a Master's in Divinity. Not a usual combination! And now you know why I am going to DBC!</p>
    <p>Interests: enjoying Brooklyn Bridge Park, spending time with my lovely wife, coding and reading about coding, and soccer, although I am not that good. (Tim Howard's performance at the World Cup got me into soccer.)</p>
    <p>Something a little odd about me: I like to eat cookies and pickles together. It's really good, you should try it.</p>
